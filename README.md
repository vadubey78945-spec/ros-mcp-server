ROS-MCP-Server connects large language models (such as Claude, GPT, and Gemini) with existing robots giving them bidirectional AI integration.  

With no changes to existing robot source code, this enables:
- 🗣 **Commanding the robot in natural language** → instructions are translated into ROS/ROS2 commands.  
- 👀 **Giving AI full visibility** → subscribe to topics, call services, read sensor data, and monitor robot state in real time.  


### ✅ Key Benefits  

- **No robot code changes** → only requires adding the `rosbridge` node.  
- **True two-way communication** → LLMs can both *control* robots and *observe* everything happening in ROS (sensors, topics, parameters).  
- **ROS1 & ROS2 support** → works with both versions out of the box.  
- **MCP-compatible** → integrates with any MCP-enabled LLM (Claude Desktop, Gemini, ChatGPT, and beyond).   

## 🎥 Examples in Action  

🖥️ **Example - Controlling the MOCA mobile manipulator in NVIDIA Isaac Sim**  
Commands are entered into Claude Desktop, which uses the MCP server to directly drive the simulated robot.

🐕 **Example - Controlling Unitree Go with natural language**  ([video](https://youtu.be/RW9_FgfxWzs?si=8bdhpHNYaupzi9q3))  
The MCP server enables the Claude to interpret images from the robot's cameras, and then command the robot based on human natural language commands.

🏭 **Example - Debugging an industrial robot** ([Video](https://youtu.be/SrHzC5InJDA))  
- Connecting to an industrial robot enables the LLM to browse all ROS topics and services to assess the robot state. 
- With no predefined context, the MCP server enables the LLM to query details about custom topic and service types and their syntax (00:28). 
- Using only natural language, the operator calls the custom services to test and debug the robot(01:42).

## ⚙️ Features of the ROS MCP Server  

- **List topics, services, and message types** → explore everything available in your robot’s ROS environment.  
- **View type definitions (incl. custom)** → understand the structure of any message.  
- **Publish/subscribe to topics** → send commands or stream robot data in real time.  
- **Call services (incl. custom)** → trigger robot functions directly.  
- **Get/set parameters** → read or adjust robot settings on the fly.  
- 🔜 **Action support** → upcoming support for ROS Actions.  
- 🔜 **Permission controls** → manage access for safer deployments.

## 🛠 Getting Started  

The MCP server is version-agnostic (ROS1 or ROS2) and works with any MCP-compatible LLM.
