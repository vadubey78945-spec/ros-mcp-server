The ROS MCP Server is designed to support robots in performing complex tasks and adapting effectively to various environments by providing a set of functions that transform natural language commands, entered by a user through an LLM, into ROS commands for robot control. Furthermore, by utilizing ``rosbridge``, it is configured to operate with both ``ROS`` and ``ROS2`` systems, and its WebSocket-based communication enables broad applicability across diverse platforms.

Research based on this project can be found in the video linked below.

## Supported Types

- geometry_msgs/Twist
- sensor_msgs/Image
- sensor_msgs/JointState

## Features

- **WebSocket-based universal compatibility**: Communicates with both ROS and ROS2 systems using rosbridge, enabling seamless integration regardless of ROS version.
- **Cross-platform support**: Works on Linux, Windows, and MacOS, making it suitable for diverse development and deployment environments.
- **Easy integration with LLMs and AI systems**: Natural language commands can be directly translated into robot actions via MCP functions.
- **Extensible function set**: Easily add new robot control or sensor functions by extending the MCP tool interface.
- **No ROS node modification required**: Interacts with existing ROS/ROS2 topics and services without changing your robot's core code.
- **Native ROS/ROS2 command compatibility**: Optionally supports using local ROS/ROS2 libraries, so you can run native ROS commands and tools alongside WebSocket-based control.

## Installation

### Installing via Smithery

To install ``ros-mcp-server`` for Claude Desktop automatically via [Smithery](https://smithery.ai/server/@lpigeon/ros-mcp-server):

```bash
npx -y @smithery/cli install @lpigeon/ros-mcp-server --client claude
```

### Installing Locally

### `uv` Installation
- To install `uv`, you can use the following command:
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```
or
```bash
pip install uv
```

- Create virtual environment and activate it (Optional)
```bash
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### MCP Server Configuration
Set MCP setting to mcp.json.

```bash
"ros-mcp-server": {
  "command": "uv",
  "args": [
    "--directory",
    "/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/PARENT/FOLDER/ros-mcp-server",,
    "run",
    "server.py"
  ]
}
```

If you use Claude Desktop, you can find mcp.json using the following command:

- MacOS/Linux
```bash
code ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
```

- Windows
```bash
code $env:AppData\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json
```

## MCP Functions

You can find the list of functions in the [MCPFUNCTIONS.md](MCPFUNCTIONS.md).

## How To Use
### 1. Set IP and Port to connect rosbridge.
- Open `server.py` and change your `LOCAL_IP`, `ROSBRIDGE_IP` and `ROSBRIDGE_PORT`. (`ROSBRIDGE_PORT`'s default value is `9090`)

### 2. Run rosbridge server.
ROS 1
```bash
roslaunch rosbridge_server rosbridge_websocket.launch
```
ROS 2
```bash
ros2 launch rosbridge_server rosbridge_websocket_launch.xml
```

### 3. Run any AI system that has imported ``ros-mcp-server``.

### 4. Type "Make the robot move forward.".
