## 1. Transport Methods

The ROS MCP server supports two transport methods:

### 1.1. STDIO Transport (Default)
- **Best for**: Local development, single-user setups
- **Pros**: Simple setup, no network configuration needed
- **Cons**: MCP server and LLM/MCP client need to be running on the local machine.
- **Use case**: Running MCP server directly with your LLM client

### 1.2. HTTP/Streamable-HTTP Transport
- **Best for**: Remote access, multiple clients, production deployments
- **Pros**: Network accessible, multiple clients can connect
- **Cons**: Requires network configuration, MCP server needs to be run independently.
- **Use case**: Remote robots, team environments, web-based clients

## 6. Troubleshooting

### 6.1. Common Issues

<details>
<summary><strong>MCP Server Not Appearing in Client</strong></summary>

**Symptoms**: The ros-mcp-server doesn't appear in your LLM client's tool list.

**Solutions**:
1. **Check file paths**: Ensure all paths in your configuration are absolute and correct
2. **Restart client**: Completely shut down and restart your LLM client
3. **Check logs**: Look for error messages in your LLM client's logs
4. **Test manually**: Try running the MCP server manually to check for errors:

```bash
cd /<ABSOLUTE_PATH>/ros-mcp-server
uv run server.py
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Connection Refused Errors</strong></summary>

**Symptoms**: "Connection refused" or "No valid session ID provided" errors.

**Solutions**:
1. **Check ROS is running**: Ensure ROS and rosbridge are running
2. **Verify rosbridge port**: Default is 9090, check if it's different
3. **Test connectivity**: Use the ping tool to test connection:

```bash
# Test if rosbridge is accessible
curl -I http://localhost:9090
```

4. **Check firewall**: Ensure firewall allows the rosbridge port

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>WSL-Specific Issues</strong></summary>

**Symptoms**: Issues when running on Windows with WSL.

**Solutions**:
1. **Check WSL distribution**: Ensure you're using the correct WSL distribution name
2. **Verify uv path**: Check that the uv path in WSL is correct:

```bash
# In WSL
which uv
```

3. **Test WSL connectivity**: Ensure Windows can reach WSL services
4. **Check WSL networking**: For HTTP transport, use `0.0.0.0` instead of `127.0.0.1`

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>HTTP Transport Issues</strong></summary>

**Symptoms**: HTTP transport not working or connection timeouts.

**Solutions**:
1. **Check environment variables**: Ensure MCP_TRANSPORT, MCP_HOST, and MCP_PORT are set correctly
2. **Verify port availability**: Check if the port is already in use:

```bash
# Check if port is in use
netstat -tulpn | grep :9000
```

3. **Test HTTP endpoint**: Try accessing the HTTP endpoint directly:

```bash
curl http://localhost:9000
```

4. **Check firewall**: Ensure firewall allows the configured port

</details>

### 6.2. Debug Commands

```bash
# Test ROS connectivity
ros2 topic list  # For ROS 2
rostopic list   # For ROS 1

# Test rosbridge
curl -I http://localhost:9090

# Test MCP server manually
cd /<ABSOLUTE_PATH>/ros-mcp-server

## 7. You're Ready to Go!

You can test out your server with any robot that you have running. Just tell your AI to connect to the robot on its target IP. (Default is localhost, so you don't need to tell it to connect if the MCP server is installed on the same machine as your ROS)

✅ **Tip:** If you don't currently have any robots running, turtlesim is considered the hello-ROS robot to experiment with. It does not have any simulation depenencies such as Gazebo or IsaacSim. 

For a complete step-by-step tutorial on using turtlesim with the MCP server and for more information on ROS and turtlesim, see our [Turtlesim Tutorial](../examples/1_turtlesim/README.md).

If you have ROS already installed, you can launch turtlesim with the below command:
**ROS1:**
```
rosrun turtlesim turtlesim_node
```

**ROS2:**
```
ros2 run turtlesim turtlesim_node
```
